# Myriad-Mobile-Pokemon
Application Project for Myriad Mobile
Prototype Pok√©dex app for applying at Myriad Mobile - 
As I am not familiar with JavaScript to fully utilize its functionality, I decided to focus primarily and the HTML and CSS side of things.
I tried to make something that looked appropriate, but not necessarily having all of the needed functionality (i.e. the search bar does not work and no JavaScript was used for generating pokemon and their respective information).
Thank you for your time and consideration!

P.S. I did start work on this one day earlier than my initial commit, but I did not know how GitHub worked until that point.
